	Learning to ride a bike is something you&#039;ll appreciate throughout your life. Kids are encouraged to be independent and explore their surroundings. Young as old, having your very own mode of transportation is a great way to explore the city around you. Almost half of all Swedes use their bike for exercise during spring, summer and fall.
	Most kids in Sweden also live close enough to their school to be able to walk or bike there on their own.
