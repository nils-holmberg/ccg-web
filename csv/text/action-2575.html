2575	With four slopes and two lifts, Hammarbybacken provides for downhill skiing in central Stockholm.
	Hammarbybacken is a genuine ski slope in Stockholm, easily accessible by bus, tram, or boat. Hammarbybacken offers most of what can be expected from an ordinary ski resort: a ski school, ski rental, and a restaurant. There are lifts and slopes for every age, and of course a funpark for everyone who likes jumps.
