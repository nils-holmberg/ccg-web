The union can often help you with finding accommodation and other practical matters.
Relations between students and teachers are highly informal. Personal initiative and independent thinking are prized.

Taking the initiative and questioning old presumptions is rewarding, especially in the long term. Many programmes also cooperate closely with industry.
