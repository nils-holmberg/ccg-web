4862	Zoom is a Swedish lightweight electric all-terrain four wheeler. You drive a Zoom sitting down, using arms and hands only. It has continuous 4-wheel drive performance under all conditions. The vehicle is for anyone, and for people with disabilities, it opens up a world of new possibilities, especially access to nature.
	Barriers and obstacles in nature that were prohibitive to those who cannot walk freely are easily overcome thanks to this recreational vehicle. The range is approximately 40 km (25 miles) per battery charge. 
Accessibility is a policy priority in Sweden, aiming to enable people with disabilities to exercise their rights as citizens, and to fulfil their obligations. The principal goal of Swedenâ€™s disability policy has long been to ensure that people in this group have power and influence over their everyday lives. To achieve this goal, the focus has been shifted from social and welfare issues to democracy and human rights.
