3084	Sweden is an ice skaterâ€™s dream, with crisp, cold winters and an enormous number of lakes (almost 100,000) and rivers, many of which freeze over in winter.
	Even the coastline is accessible by skate, and the archipelago is especially enjoyable with all its islands and islets. But be sure never to go out alone, and always with a guide or experienced friend. 
 
There are also outdoor ice rinks, if you want to get the feel of balancing on sharp blades without any risk of cold water underneath.
