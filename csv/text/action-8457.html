8457	Islam is one of the main religions in Sweden after Christianity. Ramadan is an important part of Islamâ€™s five pillars. During Ramadan, one should fast from sunrise to sunset. But since the sun does not set in northernmost Sweden during the summer, Sweden&#039;s Muslims usually relate to the hours of sunshine in locations such as Stockholm or Mecca.
	Once the fast is broken, the so-called Eid al-Fitr begins, a festivity that lasts for three days. Food is a central theme, which also gives the holiday the nickname Sweet Eid or Sugar Feast.
