1776	With roots in pagan times, Midsummer is a celebration of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, but it is also a celebration of life and love. Despite such a simple reason to celebrate, it is also the tradition that people of other cultures have the hardest time to relate to or even begin to understand. It involves picking flowers, dreaming about your future love, wearing flower wreaths, dancing like a frog around a phallic symbol. Many Swedish traditions are celebrated primarily in the countryside, at a family’s summer house or with relatives who live away from the bustling cities. And Midsummer takes the prize, where literally everyone at least attempts an exodus from the cities. You should really have spent an entire winter in Sweden to properly understand how much one can look forward to summer. Darkness and sub-zero temperatures are traded for the Midnight Sun and comfortable temperatures. This is only part of the explanation for some of the seemingly strange behaviour you are about to witness. Other explanations would include the tradition’s pagan roots, a general Swedish fascination with tradition, and finally a drink called aquavit.

1782	Swedes are so used to their independent lives that arranging elderly care is all about finding the best solution to be able to keep leading an active life.

Cheap Monday, Denim Demon, and Denim Is Dead are continuing the trend. Knitwear is another segment with several prominent Swedish designers, such as Sandra Backlund and Jumperfabriken. Swedes are known for their environmental awareness, which has rubbed off quite a bit on Swedish fashion. Brands like Denim Is Dead, Camilla Norrback and Julian Red are leading brands that profile themselves with an environmental and ethical consciousness. The interest in fashion among Swedes has exploded over the last decade. H&amp;M’s affordable yet trendy clothes are surely one explanation for this. One other explanation lies in the rich variety on offer from Swedish designers.

2644	Every year, around 100,000 Swedes graduate from secondary school, after twelve years of studies. A vital part of the Swedish graduation outfit is the student cap, which dates back to the turn of the 19th century. Students write greetings in each other’s hats, a way to remember the past years and close friends. One graduation tradition is a flatbed truck adorned with balloons and greenery, driving through the streets, honking its horn, and carrying students dancing and shouting in joy. More and more students choose to attend university after graduation but a gap year is quite common.

3058	There are a number of reasons why Swedes love to bike. They like to stay fit, they care about the environment, and they want to be outdoors. Most people lock up their bikes in a garage or basement during the winter. But more and more instead invest in winter tyres. 
3068	In Sweden, children playing outdoors are a common sight. Each season has a unique delight. Autumn is the season of leaves, colours and water.

3085	Sweden is an ice skater’s dream, with crisp, cold winters and an enormous number of lakes (almost 100,000) and rivers, many of which freeze over in winter. Even the coastline is accessible by skate, and the archipelago is especially enjoyable with all its islands and islets. But be sure never to go out alone, and always with a guide or experienced friend. There are also outdoor ice rinks, if you want to get the feel of balancing on sharp blades without any risk of cold water underneath.

3090	Usually after some time in a steaming hot sauna, people do go swimming, even after a lake has frozen over. Wood-fired saunas built next to a lake or the coast will have the ice broken up enough for a short swim, or at least a dip. The feeling afterwards is truly invigorating.

3111	With roots in pagan times, Midsummer is a celebration of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, but it is also a celebration of life and love. Despite such a simple reason to celebrate, it is also the tradition that people of other cultures have the hardest time to relate to or even begin to understand. It involves picking flowers, dreaming about your future love, wearing flower wreaths, dancing like a frog around a phallic symbol. A lot of traditions in Sweden are celebrated primarily in the country-side, at a family’s summer house or at relatives who live away from the bustling cities. And midsummer takes the price, where literally everyone at least attempts an exodus from the cities. You should really have spent an entire winter in Sweden to properly understand how much one can look forward to summer. Darkness and sub-zero temperatures are traded in for midnight sun and comfortable warmth. This is only part of the explanation for some of the seemingly strange behavior you are about to witness. Other explanations would include the tradition’s pagan roots, a general Swedish fascination with traditions, and finally a drink called aquavit. 
3121	Most of Sweden’s open space remains essentially untouched, and the right of public access means that people are free to roam the forests in search for wild berries, herbs, and mushrooms.

3123	Swedes are so used to their independent lives that arranging elderly care is all about finding the best solution to be able to keep leading active lives.

Should their health deteriorate with age, there is also special housing with around-the-clock care. Most of the elderly care is provided by municipalities, some by private operators. Life expectancy in Sweden is about 84 years for women and 81 for men 
3125	The Swedish industrial sector is characterised by very great breadth in terms of production. Sweden&#039;s domestic industries originated from its vast natural resources of forests, rich iron ore, and water power. Over the course of the 20th century, Swedish industry has evolved from traditional sectors with lower added value, such as wood and iron ore processing, to modern industries with a higher degree of skill and technology input, such as automobiles and precision and specialized engineering.

3129	Sweden is a great place if you are interested in nature. Much of the landscape is dominated by forests and meadows.

In Sweden household chores and caring for children are something that most families share. 
3212	A cinnamon bun is sure to make anyone happy. Fika is much more than having a coffee. It is a a reason to set aside a moment for quality time. It is a tradition observed frequently, preferably several times a day. Accompanying sweets are crucial. Cinnamon buns, cakes, cookies, even open-faced sandwiches will do. It comes as no surprise that Swedes are among the top consumers of coffee and sweets in the world.

4278	Sweden being geographically large with a small population has been a driving force in its development of infrastructure and communication, including mobile phones. Sweden has always had demand for solid transportation and communications networks. Early action to promote digitalisation has meant that Sweden is now one of the most connected countries in the world with one of the highest rates of computer, internet and mobile penetration. As a result, the country is frequently used as a test market for new services and technology. This has helped innovations in ICT, such as Skype. 
4282	Most Swedes separate all recyclable waste in their homes and deposit it at a recycling station. If you include burning waste to turn it into energy, more than 99 per cent of all household waste is recycled in one way or another. The next step is to burn less and reuse more. In Sweden there is a recycling premium on almost all plastic bottles and cans which is refunded once returned to the store.

437	By any measure, Sweden is a leading nation in information and communications technology (ICT). Swedes are some of the world&#039;s foremost users of information technology – such as mobile telephones, computers and networks – with one of the world&#039;s highest rates of internet usage and one of the fastest broadband networks. Sweden is second only to the UAE in smartphone penetration at 72%. 
4532	Owning a second home in the countryside is very popular among Swedes. The typical Swedish summer house is red with white trim. 
4533	A boy reads his book in bed. There is a strong connection between reading fiction and literacy. While the number of people who read books in Sweden has been stable recent decades (on any given day 36 per cent of the population over the age of 9 read a book), young people read less than they did a few years ago. A number of programmes have been set up to help maintain reading and literacy among Swedish children. 
4534	Although a majority of Swedes live in urban centres, many people still prefer the countryside, either for permanent living or for the family summer house. When kids are out of school, parents tend to make use of their holiday vacation time. What&#039;s better than to go to the countryside and spend time with your kids? 
4547	Comic Con Gamex is Sweden&#039;s largest combined exhibition fair for games, comic books, and film. The first combined exhibit was held during the autumn of 2014 in Kista outside Stockholm.Visitors can indulge in new games, comics and films, meet and greet developers, comic book creators and members of Hollywood film and comics industries. The gaming industry in Sweden is currently in an expansive period and several major games have Swedish developers. 
4555	To dress up and play is both fun and important. 
4557	During the Swedish spring and summer, people tend to be outdoors as much as possible. That includes eating and drinking. Swedes love to barbecue. As soon as the snow melts away, the grills come out of storage. Barbecues are as Swedish as, say, meatballs. For certain holidays, especially Walpurgis Night – the traditional spring festival on April 30 – it is almost required that you attend or arrange a barbecue party. Potatoes, fish, maize, meat, vegetables, and mushrooms — almost anything you can eat can be grilled, if you ask a Swede. Stores sell pre-marinated meats and at the checkout counters there are piles of bags of briquettes and single-use miniature grills. Both a method of adding variation to traditional Swedish cooking and a way to spend time with friends and family, the barbecue party remains a seasonal treat. 
4559	A boy is cleaning rhubarb in the summer sun. The Swedish climate is great for growing rhubarb, and many family gardens include them. Rhubarb pie is a popular dessert.

4712	Sweden has four distinct seasons, and a lot of people prefer winter both for its serenity and the activities it allows for, such as alpine skiing. For a winter break in Sweden, there are plenty of family-friendly winter resorts to choose from. Åre is one of many top destinations. Although the Swedish mountain range is not extremely high in elevation (the highest peak is about 2,100 metres or 6,900 feet), it offers everything from family-friendly runs to daring off-piste skiing, and in the very north the season runs well past midsummer.
