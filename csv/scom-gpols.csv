Kids are encouraged to be independent and explore their surroundings. Young as old, having your very own mode of transportation is a great way to explore the city around you.

Parental leave is paid for 480 days, shared between mother and father, and amounts to a large portion of your usual salary. 60 days are reserved for each parent. This is mainly to encourage equality and shared responsibility."

Sweden has always had demand for solid transportation and communications networks. Early action to promote digitalisation has meant that Sweden is now one of the most connected countries in the world with one of the highest rates of computer, internet and mobile penetration. As a result, the country is frequently used as a test market for new services and technology."

The union is the organisation you will be most in contact with when arranging accommodation.

"ulf_lundin-student-1324-7"	1324	"Sweden offers an international academic environment—there were around 27,000 new international students at Swedish universities in 2016/2017. Sweden is one of the world’s most innovative and research-intensive nations. Institutions like Lund University, Karolinska Institutet and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) place high in European rankings, and the research carried out there has contributed to the global success of Sweden’s many high-tech companies. All Swedish university students are entitled to financial assistance, partly in the form of a grant and partly as a loan. The rate at which they pay it back depends on their income when they start working. Tuition fees are fully subsidised for students from Sweden, the EU/EEA area, and Switzerland. Students from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland pay tuition fees but scholarship programs that cover tuition and living costs are available for a number of non-EU countries. Some 3.25 per cent of Sweden’s GDP goes towards research and development, one of the highest rates in the world. As a result, Sweden has a leading position in areas like environmental technology, cancer research and nanotechnology."

Sweden has four distinct seasons, and while summer is definitely appreciated, some people prefer winter both for its serenity and the activities it allows. In most parts of Sweden winter means snow. In the northern mountains it can arrive while the rest of the country is still enjoying autumn colours, and in the south there are years with basically no snow at all."
"august_dellert-the_edible_country-7563-7"	7563	"The Edible Country is an initiative from Sweden, where the whole country is turned into a DIY-restaurant. Top chefs were invited to compose menus based on ingredients that can be found in Swedish nature. Several wooden tables were placed all over Sweden, and anyone can make a reservation to create a Swedish meal sourced in nature and then enjoy it in stunning scenery. Swedish forests are filled with edible treats such as berries, mushroom, nettles and other greens, and they are of course best enjoyed in the outdoors. The Swedish Right of Public Access entitles you to forage and set up camp almost anywhere you want in Swedish nature, as long as you treat flora, fauna and other people&#039;s property with respect and care."

The consensus process is often about getting everybody on board. At Swedish meetings, everyone voices an opinion and everyone listens. Then they compromise. With its highly skilled labour force and smooth business procedures, Sweden remains one of the world’s most competitive economies. It is also a global leader in innovation."

"elisabeth_edén-outdoor_eating-4557-7"	4557	"During the Swedish spring and summer, people tend to be outdoors as much as possible. That includes eating and drinking. Swedes love to barbecue. As soon as the snow melts away, the grills come out of storage. Barbecues are as Swedish as, say, meatballs. For certain holidays, especially Walpurgis Night – the traditional spring festival on April 30 – it is almost required that you attend or arrange a barbecue party. Potatoes, fish, maize, meat, vegetables, and mushrooms — almost anything you can eat can be grilled, if you ask a Swede. Stores sell pre-marinated meats and at the checkout counters there are piles of bags of briquettes and single-use miniature grills. Both a method of adding variation to traditional Swedish cooking and a way to spend time with friends and family, the barbecue party remains a seasonal treat."

Parental leave is paid for 480 days, shared between mother and father, and amounts to a large portion of your usual salary. 60 days are reserved for each parent. This is mainly to encourage equality and shared responsibility. Fathers are also entitled to 10 extra paid days of leave when the child is born. Gender equality is apparent in Sweden. It can be seen out on the streets, where both women and men hurry to and from work and go shopping. It can be seen in the many prams being wheeled around by men, not just women. In Sweden household chores and caring for children are something that most families share."

The right also brings responsibilities – to treat flora and fauna and other people’s property with care. It can be summed up in the phrase ‘don’t disturb, don’t destroy’.

Roughly 260 guide dogs are currently active in Sweden."

Yiddish is an official minority language, protected by Swedish law, as is the Jewish culture. Today, Sweden&#039;s Jewish community is estimated at 15 000-20 000 people. Sweden is home to many different faiths and religions. There are several synagogues and Jewish cemeteries in Sweden, as well as many other places of worship. Jews are one of the five official national minorities in Sweden. Hanukkah (chanukka) is a Jewish holiday celebrated to commemorate the re-opening of the Temple in Jerusalem in 164 BC. The eight-day festival of lights is celebrated with a nightly menorah lighting, prayers and traditional food.       Each night of Hanukkah, candles are lit in the Menorah candlestick – one candle on the first day, two on the second, and so on until all eight candles are lit on the last night.    "
"sofia_sabel-jumperfabriken-1786-7"	1786	"A lot is happening in Swedish fashion. While the tradition of functionality has not been completely abandoned, several designers have moved toward a more individual expression. What has been called “the Swedish fashion miracle” started in the denim world, with brands like Acne, Nudie, Julian Red, and WESC. Cheap Monday, Denim Demon, and Denim Is Dead are continuing the trend. Knitwear is another segment with several prominent Swedish designers, such as Sandra Backlund and Jumperfabriken. Swedes are known for their environmental awareness, which has rubbed off quite a bit on Swedish fashion. Brands like Denim Is Dead, Camilla Norrback and Julian Red are leading brands that profile themselves with an environmental and ethical consciousness. The interest in fashion among Swedes has exploded over the last decade. H&amp;M’s affordable yet trendy clothes are surely one explanation for this. One other explanation lies in the rich variety on offer from Swedish designers."

"stefan_berg-midsummer_celebration-3111-7"	3111	"With roots in pagan times, Midsummer is a celebration of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, but it is also a celebration of life and love. Despite such a simple reason to celebrate, it is also the tradition that people of other cultures have the hardest time to relate to or even begin to understand. It involves picking flowers, dreaming about your future love, wearing flower wreaths, dancing like a frog around a phallic symbol. A lot of traditions in Sweden are celebrated primarily in the country-side, at a family’s summer house or at relatives who live away from the bustling cities. And midsummer takes the price, where literally everyone at least attempts an exodus from the cities. You should really have spent an entire winter in Sweden to properly understand how much one can look forward to summer. Darkness and sub-zero temperatures are traded in for midnight sun and comfortable warmth. This is only part of the explanation for some of the seemingly strange behavior you are about to witness. Other explanations would include the tradition’s pagan roots, a general Swedish fascination with traditions, and finally a drink called aquavit."

It can be a picnic, barbecue or just bringing a bowl of soup into the garden."
